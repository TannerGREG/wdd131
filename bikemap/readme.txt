This page uses a google maps api, which is I don't want to upload to GitHub, so its hidden in a .env  "API_KEY={keyGoesHere}" 
that is hidden with a .gitignore file.

In order to use the map fuctionality you need make a local copy of the repository and place the .env and .gitignore file in the bikemap
folder on the root of the folder.

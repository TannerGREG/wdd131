                I noticed a transportation problem in the Rexburg area. It seems like there is never enough parking spaces to accomidate the ammount of drivers.
                 I also know that it would be impracticle to just make more parking spaces. Thinking of other ideas on how to solve the transportation problem, 
                 I thought what if more cars isn't the answer.

                What if we got more people on bikes instead. They are small, compact and perfect for Colledge life.
                  This website is to deminstrate how a bike rental service might look in Rexburg.
